# ARco
AR procedural glass parabola generation between anchor points in space.

### Class CSCI - 716

### Team

# Propsal

### Summary
- Create an Augmented Reality (AR) app that allows the user to create glass arcs between AR anchor points in space
- The arcs will be a tesselated shape derived from a 3D vornoi diagram
- The arc will used procedurally generated seed points for the voronoi algorithm
- The arc will be interactable via "shattering" the arc into glass shards
- The shattering glass is also based on a vornoi algorithm

### Goals
- Demonstrate knowledge from the Computation Geometry Course
- Demonstrate knowldege of Voronoi Algorithms
- Allow user to create arcs between points in space
- Allow user to interact the with arcs
- Implement latest and relevant research involved in 3D vornoi algorithms and Augmented Reality

#### Stretch Goals
- Shattering and recombining glass shards

### System & Software
